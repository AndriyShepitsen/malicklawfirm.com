		Malick Law Firm community involvement is consistent with our company's principles and with our mission
to provide high quality legal advice and assistance to all members of  North Chicago Community.
	
	That is why Malick Law Firm designed to help bridge the justice gap by providing access to the justice system 
for low and moderate income individuals. When free legal services are unavailable and private attorneysâ€™ 
fees are unaffordable,Malick Law firm offers low cost legal assistance on a sliding scale basis.

	<p>
	We focused on serving people who are traditionally within low and moderate income ranges or on fixed incomes, such as senior citizens, recent immigrants, victims of domestic violence, and people with disabilities. We believe that working families should also be able to access justice regardless of how much or how little they earn.
