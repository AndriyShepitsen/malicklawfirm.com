	<h4>Federal Estate Tax Exemption</h4>

	<p>The current Federal Estate Tax exemption (reflected as a credit equivalent) has increased to 
		$2.0 million dollars, for decedents dying after January 1, 2006. This may affect the allocation 
		between marital (Trust A) and by-pass trusts (Trust B or Credit shelter), depending upon the 
		Trust language used in the underlying trust document. This may also affect the amount qualifying 
		for the marital deduction and available for the surviving spouse. The exemption will increase to
		$3.5 million for decedents dying after January 1, 2009. Check back for more updates as Congress 
		debates this important estate planning regulation.

	<h3>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 </h3>

	<p>A new law was enacted recently called the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 
		1996 (aka HIPAA), 42 USC 1320d and 45 CFR 160-164. A provision, which we attach at the end of the 
		Power of Attorney for Health Care, enables your Agent to access all of your medical records after 
		you have become incapacitated. This is a necessity if you expect your Agent to act in your best 
		interest after you have been deemed incapable of making your own decisions. 
		How can the Agent make the best decision if they don’t have access to your medical history? 
		I strongly encourage you to contact our law firm regarding this new law, if you have not already 
		done so, and either add it to your existing Power of Attorney, or create a new, 
		updated Power of Attorney.

	<h3>State of Illinois Probate Court</h3>

	<p>The State of Illinois has increased the minimum amount of property, held in your name alone subject to the Probate jurisdiction, from $50,000 to $100,000. This means that upon your death, all assets held in your name alone that total over $100,000 must be subjected to the Probate court process. This process wastes time, money and energy for the Nominated Executor of your Estate. Save your loved ones a nuisance by creating a Living Trust, and by transferring your assets into that Trust. Assets in your name alone, under $100,000, may now be transferred by Small Estate Affidavit, prepared 30 days after the death of the decedent. Any estates that are transferred by affidavit are not subject to jurisdiction by the Probate Court. The estate totaling less than $100,000, however, will still be subject to creditors’ claims for two (2) years after transfer by affidavit. </p>
	<p>Some assets you own are outside of the Probate Court’s jurisdiction, but you still want to make sure the beneficiaries of these assets are designated correctly. These assets include: 401K’s or other retirement plans, IRA plans, Life insurance, and some savings accounts or CDs. In order to make the transition smoother after your death, make sure the beneficiaries for these assets are 1) correctly designated the way you would like them, and 2) clearly designated on all documents, to avoid confusion and resentment from your descendants. In addition to clarifying the beneficiary designation, you may want to investigate the tax consequences of beneficiaries withdrawing the principal of these plans after your death. One option many companies offer is to enable the spouse to roll-over your 401K into his or her own IRA. This will prevent the spouse from being taxed on the full amount on their individual income tax for the year of withdrawal.</p>
