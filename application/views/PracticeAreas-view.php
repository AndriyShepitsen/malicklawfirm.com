		<h2>Estate planning - Wills and Trusts</h2>

		<dl>
			<dt>What exactly is estate planning?</dt>
			<dd>Estate planning is the process of deciding who will get your property and how you would like it transferred after your death. It can also involve designating a guardian for young children or a representative to make financial and medical decisions for you if you become incapacitated.</dd>

			<dt>Why would I want to avoid probate?</dt>
			<dd>Probate is an official court proceeding in which the estate of the decedent is divided according to a will (if one exists) or state succession laws (if no will exists). It is also a lengthy process (it usually takes 9-14 months) and involves a lot of paperwork, time, and money.  In addition, the documents filed in a probate proceeding are a matter of public record, and some may wish to avoid public scrutiny of their financial situation.</dd>

			<dt>What's the difference between a will and a living trust?</dt>
			<dd>A will is a legal document that becomes effective upon your death and details how you want your property distributed.  All property left in a will must go through probate court. A living trust, on the other hand, is in effect while you're still living; you transfer the property into the trust, yet you still have control of the trust and can make changes or additions. Property distributed via living trust is generally not subject to probate.</dd>

			<dt>What are some other options besides wills and trusts?</dt>
			There are several alternatives to wills, and many people choose to have a combination of estate planning devices, such as a living trust, a "Payable on Delivery" (POD) bank account, in which the funds automatically transfer to another in the case of death, or a "back-up" will. The resources in this guide provide information on these and other estate-planning tools.

		<h2>Probate</h2>

		<p>Receipt of probate is the first step in the legal process of administering 
			the estate of a deceased person, resolving all claims and distributing the deceased person's 
			property under a will. A probate court (surrogate court) decides the legal validity of a 
			testator's will and grants its approval by granting probate to the executor. 
			The probated will becomes a legal document that may be enforced by the executor in the 
			law-courts if necessary. A probate also officially appoints the executor 
			(or personal representative), generally named in the will, as having legal power
			 to dispose of the testator's assets in the manner specified in the will.
		</p>


		<h2>Trust Administration</h2>

		<p>Trust administration involves overseeing the assets held within a trust. 
			A trust is a form of legal property ownership in which an ownership interest in real or personal 
			property is split. Trusts are commonly created as an estate planning tool, and the trust 
			administrator then oversees the distribution of assets within the trust according to the 
			wishes of its creator.
		</p>

		<p>There are many different aspects to owning property. 
			Mainly, property ownership involves the right of possession, the right of use, the right to 
			transfer or sell property and the right to will the property to heirs upon death. 
			When a trust is created, the ownership of the property is vested in the trust, which 
			is a legal creation. The beneficiary of the trust is then vested with limited rights 
			according to the terms of the trust; the beneficiary may have the right to use items within 
			the trust but not to sell them or transfer them or may have limited usage rights and 
			restrictions on what he may do with the assets held in the trust. 
		</p>
		<p>When a trust is created, in addition to naming the beneficiary or the person who is entitled 
			to use the trust assets, a trustee must also be named. That trustee is responsible for trust 
			administration. This means he is responsible for protecting the assets in the trust and ensuring 
			they are used according to the wishes of the individual who established the trust.
