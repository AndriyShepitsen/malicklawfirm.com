	<h2>Estate planning - Wills and Trusts</h2>
	<hr/>
	<dl>
		<dt>What exactly is estate planning?</dt>
		<dd>Estate planning is the process of deciding who will get your property and how you would like it transferred after your death. It can also involve designating a guardian for young children or a representative to make financial and medical decisions for you if you become incapacitated.</dd>
	
		<dt>Why would I want to avoid probate?</dt>
		<dd>Probate is an official court proceeding in which the estate of the decedent is divided according to a will (if one exists) or state succession laws (if no will exists). It is also a lengthy process (it usually takes 9-14 months) and involves a lot of paperwork, time, and money.  In addition, the documents filed in a probate proceeding are a matter of public record, and some may wish to avoid public scrutiny of their financial situation.</dd>
	
		<dt>What's the difference between a will and a living trust?</dt>
		<dd>A will is a legal document that becomes effective upon your death and details how you want your property distributed.  All property left in a will must go through probate court. A living trust, on the other hand, is in effect while you're still living; you transfer the property into the trust, yet you still have control of the trust and can make changes or additions. Property distributed via living trust is generally not subject to probate.</dd>
	
		<dt>What are some other options besides wills and trusts?</dt>
		There are several alternatives to wills, and many people choose to have a combination of estate planning devices, such as a living trust, a "Payable on Delivery" (POD) bank account, in which the funds automatically transfer to another in the case of death, or a "back-up" will. The resources in this guide provide information on these and other estate-planning tools.

	<h2>Probate</h2>
	<hr/>
	<p>Receipt of probate is the first step in the legal process of administering 
		the estate of a deceased person, resolving all claims and distributing the deceased person's 
		property under a will. A probate court (surrogate court) decides the legal validity of a 
		testator's will and grants its approval by granting probate to the executor. 
		The probated will becomes a legal document that may be enforced by the executor in the 
		law-courts if necessary. A probate also officially appoints the executor 
		(or personal representative), generally named in the will, as having legal power
		 to dispose of the testator's assets in the manner specified in the will.
	</p>
	 <p>Malick Law Firm  can help prepare the most optimal plan according to the Illinois State law or just provide  comprehensive information 
	 	 about the probate process.</p>
	
	<h2>Trust Administration</h2>
	<hr/>
	<p>Trust administration involves overseeing the assets held within a trust. 
		A trust is a form of legal property ownership in which an ownership interest in real or personal 
		property is split. Trusts are commonly created as an estate planning tool, and the trust 
		administrator then oversees the distribution of assets within the trust according to the 
		wishes of its creator.
	</p>


	<p>There are many different aspects to owning property. 
		Mainly, property ownership involves the right of possession, the right of use, the right to 
		transfer or sell property and the right to will the property to heirs upon death. 
		When a trust is created, the ownership of the property is vested in the trust, which 
		is a legal creation. The beneficiary of the trust is then vested with limited rights 
		according to the terms of the trust; the beneficiary may have the right to use items within 
		the trust but not to sell them or transfer them or may have limited usage rights and 
		restrictions on what he may do with the assets held in the trust. 
	</p>
	<p>When a trust is created, in addition to naming the beneficiary or the person who is entitled 
		to use the trust assets, a trustee must also be named. That trustee is responsible for trust 
		administration. This means he is responsible for protecting the assets in the trust and ensuring 
		they are used according to the wishes of the individual who established the trust. 
	</p>

	<p>Malick Law Firm is providing highly ethical and reliable administration to a variety of trusts, maintaining the fiscal strength of these entities to serve beneficiaries through the intended life of the trust. 
		We are available to provide administration services to new clients from North Chicago Land</p>

<h2>Family Law (uncontested divorces)</h2>
			<hr/>
	<p>
		Most of divorces in the U.S. are "uncontested", where divorcing parties agree on the terms of separation, without 
		the need for litigation in a court of law. These couples are in agreement on basic matters such as financial and 
		property division, custodial rights, asset and estate division, legal expenses and living arrangements. 
	</p>

	<p>
		In case of uncontested divorce Malick Law Firm will prepare divorce documents using the latest court forms.
		 Our documents are attorney-approved and are guaranteed to be accepted by the Court.
